    <p class="newsitem">Thanks to the Italian Agile community for the great welcome 
        I received at <a href="http://www.agileday.it">Italian Agile Days</a> in Urbino, 
        November 17-18, 2017. It was my first time giving a keynote in Italian and although 
        it was rough in places, folks were tolerant and really seemed to get the message 
        about getting "Back to Basics". This community seems very strong and are ready to 
        revitalize their practice of Agile!</p>
