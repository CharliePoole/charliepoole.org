<h1>Communicating Through Tests<br>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This workshop explores the use of tests in agile development, emphasizing the role of tests in facilitating feedback through communication: communication about requirements, communication about project design, communication about project status.

<p>The workshop will begin with an introductory talk and a thirty minute pair presentation by the leaders followed by four " iterations." Each iteration will consist of approximately 5 minutes of planning, 30 minutes of work and 15 minutes of retrospective and 10 minutes of break.

<p>Each iteration will introduce a new focus. Several options are available and we will poll the group beforehand to determine the contents of each iterationl. We imagine that the focus will proceed as follows but reserve the option of making changes focus should it become clear that the workshop will be so improved.

<ul>
	<li>installing and configuring software
	<li>reading and learning from existing tests and code
	<li>constructing tests to guide development
	<li>organizing tests for long term value
	<li>exploring roles in planning, development and test
</ul>

<p>Attention will be on both unit testing and customer testing in both C# and Java. For a small homogenous small group, we can concentrate on one of these rather than doing both. However, seeing similar things done in several environments seems to be useful to many people. For both types of test, we follow the general sequence above either sequentially or in parallel. Software will be available at the workshop and we will conduct an iteration of installation if there is sufficient need and interest. For those wanting to install software in advance, a list of the software used and a set of download links will be provided.

<p>Depending on the availability of laptops and software within the group, students may work in pairs or larger groups on tasks consistent with the focus or they may participate with a workshop leader who will attempt the same tasks in a small group using a projector. If two projectors and screens are available, we will each work with a group. Students are asked to change pairs for each iteration and are encouraged to seek out those with different skill sets from their own. As in any software project, our success depends on the level of task completion by all participants. For that reason, we will judge the success of the workshop by the number of tasks completed by the least successful students.

<h2>Note:</h2>

<p>The half-day schedule assumes all software is installed in advance. We can accommodate doing the installation during the workshop if necessary by shortening the individual iterations. Half-day workshops will probably work better if a single platform and language are used.
