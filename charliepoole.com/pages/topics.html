<h2>Agile Development</h2>

<p>
   Recent years have seen the growth of the Agile Movement and various
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=agile">agile methodologies</a>. 
   
   I think this is one of the most important trends in software development today.

   I'm currently focusing on <a href="cp.php?p=xp">Extreme Programming</a>
   in my own work.
</p>

<h2>Software Design and Architecture</h2>

<p>
   As <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html">Martin Fowler tells us</a>,
   software design is not dead. 
   The agile development and patterns communities actually have a lot in common.
   I make a lot of use of <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=patterns">Design Patterns</a> in my
   work but these days I try to avoid applying them up front and all at once.
</p>

<h2>Programming Languages</h2>

<p>
   The first programming language I learned was <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=pli">PLI</a>.
   
   In those early years I also worked in Fortran, COBOL, BASIC and in the
   assembly language for various mainframe computers.
   
   In the mid-70s I learned <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=c">C</a> - the K&R flavor. 
   
   I also played around with <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=simula">Simula</a> which
   helped prepare me for learning <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=cpp">C++</a>.
</p>
<p>
   These days, I'm quite intrigued by <a href="cp.php?p=csharp">C#</a> and the 
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=dotnet">.Net</a> environment.
   
   I'm also experimenting with <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=ruby">Ruby</a>, 
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> and 
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=java">Java</a>.
    
   However, <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=cpp">C++</a> remains the language I use in most of my work.</p>

<h2>Windows Development</h2>

<p>
   Most of my work in the last 10 years has been for the Windows platform. 

   I have worked (and still do) using the<a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=winsdk">Windows SDK</a>
   as well as <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=mfc">Microsoft Foundation Classes</a>. 

   I've done <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=com">COM Programming</a> using native calls as well as through
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=atl">ATL</a> and <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=wtl">WTL</a>. 

   Lately I've been working with the <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=dotnet">.Net</a> environment.

<h2>Database Development</h2>

<p>
   I originally worked in SQL applications on IBM mainframes. 
   Recently, I had occasion to renew my knowledge of SQL and found it still works
   pretty much the same way!!!
