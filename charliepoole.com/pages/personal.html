<h1>Charlie Poole</h1>

<p>This page has some info about me, my family, my personal interests and
   community activities. It's aimed at family and friends but anyone is
   welcome to read it.</p>

   
	Right now, all it has is this link to some photos of the

At this point in my life, I have a lot of interests beyond software development. 
I try to limit my work to 6-8 months each year, although it's not always possible.
When not working, I'm involved in travel, sailing and family activities and I
dedicate a lot of time to working with the local schools. I'm very interested
in exchange programs and have taken groups of high school students on extended 
trips to Russia twice.

I live in a pleasant area across Puget Sound from Seattle and enjoy being
involved in community activities. I'm a member of the Spectrum Community School 
Human Rights board and have a strong interest in alternative schools. I've been 
recognized on several occasions for my contributions, including receiving the 
Year 2001 award of the S'Klallam Tribal Anti-Racism Committee. I serve on the
Capital Facilities Advisory Committee for the school district. One of my great
pleasures has been to organize an annual Thanksgiving Dinner for students
at the Spectrum Community School.
