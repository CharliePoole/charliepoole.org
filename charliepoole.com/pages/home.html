<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>I'm putting this site back online after a hiatus. It was not updated for many years
   and has been offline for a while due to server issues. What's here is rather
   out of date, but I'll be working to update it in the coming months.

<p>I'm an independent software developer, trainer and coach working
   primarily in the Northwest. I've been developing software for over
   40 years and <b>I'm still not bored!</b> If you like, you can read
   my <a href="cp.php?p=bio">informal bio</a> or take a look at my 
   <a href="cp.php?p=resume">resume</a>. 

<h2>What's Here?</h2>
   
<p>This is my professional and technical site and is mostly aimed at
   at fellow developers. It currently houses my blog 
   <a href="./blog/">It&apos;s the Tests!</a> as well as a number of
   articles I've written over the years.</p>

<p>I hope to make it a useful resource to others, so
   please <a href="cp.php?p=contact">contact me</a>
   if you have suggestions.</p>

<!--
<p>Recent years have seen the growth of the Agile Movement and various
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=agile">agile methodologies</a>. I
   use both <a href="cp.php?p=xp">Extreme Programming</a> and Scrum
   in my own work.</p>
   
<p>I'm heavily into <a href="cp.php?p=tdd">test-driven development</a>
   and I'm one of the developers of the <a href="cp.php?p=nunit">
   NUnit</a> unit-testing framework. The <a href="cp.php?p=nunit_cookbook">
   NUnit Cookbook</a> is my book-in-process on NUnit.</p>
    
<p>In recent years, my technical focus has been on the
   <a class="coming" href="cp.php?p=dotnet">.Net</a> environment.
   I do most of programming for .NET in <a href="cp.php?p=csharp">C#</a>.
   Before .NET, I was primarily a <a href="cp.php?p=cpp">C++</a>
   programmer, and still work with it when I can.</p>
