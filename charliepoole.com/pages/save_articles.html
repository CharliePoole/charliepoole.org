		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>09/28/2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		In the final article of this series, we finally do what we set out to do.
		The wizard generates code tailored to a specific class in the solution
		selected by the user. But was it worth it?

		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>09/27/2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		In the second article of this series, the wizard actually does what 
		wizards are supposed to do... generate code. There's also a user
		input form that sets some options for the code...

		<b><a href="article.php?p=cswizardry_part1">C# Wizardry: Getting Started</a></b>
		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>09/25/2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		In this first article of a series on writing a test fixture generation
		wizard for Visual Studio, I describe the framework of a wizard and how 
		it is called. Even though my first cut at a wizard does nothing but 
		display the parameters passed to it, there were a lot of obstacles
		to overcome in getting there...

		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>03/26/2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		In this experience paper prepared for a workshop at XP2002, I try
		to draw some lessons from a rather mixed experience with XP on
		a certain project. We turned the project around, but was that enough?

		<b><a href="article.php?p=tfc_part4">Test First Challenge: Table Model</a></b>
		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>January, 2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		In this last article - at least for a while - we adapt the design to a 
		2-D table model which may or may not help when we come to doing a GUI
		front end...

		<b><a href="article.php?p=tfc_part3">Test First Challenge: Cell References</a></b>
		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>January, 2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		This new installment adds cell references to the formulas we evaluate. 
		But that introduces the problem of circular references...

		<b><a href="article.php?p=tfc_interlude1">Test First Challenge: Refactoring the Formula Parser</a></b>
		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>January, 2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		After so much code being added, some refactoring was called for, 
		so I did it. A lot of change was involved. Was it worth it?

		<b><a href="article.php?p=tfc_part2">Test First Challenge: Basic Formulas</a></b>
		&nbsp;Charlie Poole&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=-1>January, 2002</font>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		In this second article in the series, we develop the ability to parse 
		simple constant expressions. I changed things several times as I was
		developing the parser, so this part is in four different installments.

		 In January 2002, Bill Wake issued a 
		 <a href="http://xp123.com/xplor/xp0201/">Test-first Challenge</a>
		 as a way to encourage the practice test-first development. I participated.
		 Bill provided a set of tests that drive the development of a simple 
		 spreadsheet. This first article describes the tests and code for
		 storing and retrieving the raw contents of cells...
