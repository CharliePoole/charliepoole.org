<h1>Poetry Magnets: Third Verse<br>
<span class="author">Charlie Poole</span><br>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref1"><h2>Jagged Lines</h2></a>


<p>In the <a href="poetry_magnets_part1.html">first</a> and
   <a href="poetry_magnets_part2.html">second</a> articles of this series,
   we solved all the easiest parts of the problem. We can now display correct
   text for single or multiple lines of text, subject to certain constraints...</p>
   
<ul>
   <li>Magnets are always perfectly horizontal.</li>
   <li>Magnets on the same line are always perfectly aligned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these are likely to be true - they certainly haven't been for
   most refrigerator magnets I've seen!</p>
   
<p>In this article, we'll try to remove the second constraint. We'll allow the
   magnets to be placed in jagged lines, so long as there is sufficient overlap
   with other magnets so that a human reader would see them as a single line.
   We don't know exactly what that means yet, but we'll figure it out as we 
   write the tests.</p>
   
<p>In order to express the concept of "overlap" in the vertical dimension, the
   magnets must have a height. Since we ordained at the start that all magnets 
   are the same height, the size we pick is irrelevant. More precisely, it's a
   matter of scaling. Since we started out using integers as positions, I'm 
   picking 100 as the standard height of a magnet. That will allow me to think
   about my tests as expressing some percentage of overlap, but it's only for 
   my own convenience.</p>
   
<p>Here's a first test...</p>

<pre class="code">[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...

    <b>[Test]
    public void TwoMagnetsWithVerticalOverlap()
    {
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 1000, 700, "Hello" ) );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 2000, 720, "World" ) );
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }</b>
}</pre>

<p>I scaled up the X values to look right with the Y values, even though
   this isn't strictly necessary - our code so far doesn't make any use of
   them except for sorting. To keep the old tests valid, I multiplied all
   the coordinates by 100 as well.</p>
   
<p>Running the test above, we're happy to see a red bar! We like our tests to
   start out failing, so we can have the fun of making them pass. The error 
   message is...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
expected: "Hello World"
 but was: "Hello\nWorld"
</pre>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref2"><h2>Unfinished Business</h2></a>


<p>My first cut at making this test pass, was to revise the <b>CompareTo</b> 
   method used in the sort. Here's one version...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
public class Magnet : IComparable
{
    ...
    int IComparable.CompareTo(object other)
    {
        Magnet m = (Magnet)other;
		
		<b>if ( Math.Abs( this.Y - m.Y ) &lt; 100 )
		   return this.X.CompareTo(m.X);
		   
		return this.Y.CompareTo(m.Y);</b>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>I revised this several ways and finally tested the sort. It worked! But the
   same error message - the one with an extra '\n' in the output - continued 
   to appear. As with many such problems, the cause was obvious when I finally
   saw it. It's these lines in the <b>MagneticSurface.Text</b> property...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
    if ( lastY != mag.Y )
        sb.Append( '\n' );
    else
        sb.Append( ' ' );
</pre>

<p>Even if two magnets are on the same line, we insert a <b>newline</b> if the
   Y coordinates are different!</p>
   
<p>We can fix this, but it seems important to reflect on how it happened first.
   The original code contains duplication, which I failed to notice and remove.
   The concept of two magnets being on the same line is expressed in two different
   ways in the code. Let's fix that...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
public class Magnet : IComparable
{
    ...
    int IComparable.CompareTo(object other)
    {
        Magnet m = (Magnet)other;
		
		<b>if ( this.InSameLineAs( m ) )</b>
		   return this.X.CompareTo(m.X);
		   
		return this.Y.CompareTo(m.Y);
    }
	
    <b>private bool InSameLineAs( Magnet other )
    {
        return Math.Abs( this.Y - m.Y ) &lt; 100 );
    }</b>
}
</pre>
