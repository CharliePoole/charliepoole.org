<a name="ref1"><h2>Where Were We?</h2></a>


<p>I've been on vacation, so I didn't follow up on the 
   <a href="poetry_magnets_part1.html">first part</a> of this series, as
   quickly as I intended. So let's recap...</p>
   
<p>We're trying to solve this problem...</p>

<ul>
   <li>Magnets with words on them are placed on a surface. The 
       magnets are rectangular in shape and are all the same height. Their length 
       varies depending on their content. They may be placed in any location and
	   oriented horizontally, vertically or at some other angle. Due to physical
	   limitations, they may not overlap.</li>
   <li>The program should take a list of magnets, with the location, orientation 
       and content of each one, and produce a text string that concatenates them 
       in the order a human would read them. The text should be broken into lines
       if the layout "looks like" a set of lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>I deliberately chose a rather naive approach: the magnets were initially 
   represented as strings, without any additional info as to their position.
   We were able to get started but ran into a problem, as you might expect.</p>
   
<p>We want both of the following tests to pass...</p>

<pre class="code">[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...

	[Test]
    public void TwoMagnets()
    {
        <b>magnets.Add( "Hello" );
        magnets.Add( "World" );</b>
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }

    [Test]
    public void TwoMagnetsInWrongOrder()
    {
        <b>magnets.Add( "World" );
        magnets.Add( "Hello" );</b>
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }
}</pre>

<p>...but one of them must obviously fail. We're only giving the MagneticSurface
   two pieces of info about each magnet: the text and the order in which we place
   them on the surface. The problem statement implies that each magnet should have
   a position, so we need to add more info.</p>
   
<div class="sidebar">

<a name="ref2"><h2>Why Didn't We Just Do It Right the First Time?</h2></a>


<p>Actually, it <i>was</i> pretty clear that we would need a Magnet object at 
   the start, so we might have created one right away. The problem is, we didn't
   quite know what that object needed to do, so we might have given it too much
   functionality, or the wrong functionality. Now we have a specific objective:
   to make our latest test pass. And that's all the object needs to do for us
   at the moment.</p>
   
</div>

<p>We like to refactor on a green bar, so we first comment out (or Ignore) the
   failing test, <b>TwoMagnetsInWrongOrder()</b>. All tests pass. Now, we need
   to add a Magnet object, while keeping the tests passing.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref3"><h2>Adding the Magnet Object</h2></a>


<p>To keep things simple - and because this is after all a demonstration of 
   programming in small steps - we'll first create a magnet object that has
   nothing more than a text field. We rewrite all our tests to have code
   similar to this...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...
    [Test]
    public void TwoMagnets()
    {
        <b>magnets.Add( new Magnet("Hello") );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet("World") );</b>
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>To make it compile, we need a magnet class...</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>public class Magnet
{
    public string Text;
	
    public Magnet( string text )
    {
        this.Text = text;
    }
}</b>
</pre>

<p>...and a small change to the <b>MagneticSurface</b> class...</p>

<pre class="code">
public class MagneticSurface
{
    private string text = "";

    public string Text
    {
        <b>return text;</b>
    }

    public void Add( <b>Magnet</b> magnet )
    {
        if ( this.text != string.Empty )
            this.text += " ";
        <b>this.text += magnet.Text;</b>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>All tests continue to pass. Now, continuing to refactor, we'll add a horizontal
   position to the magnet. We could also add a vertical coordinate and it wouldn't
   do any harm. But we don't need it now and I'm making a point here: it's possible
   to code <i>only what you need</i> for each test without doing an excessive 
   amount of rework. Here's the new <b>Magnet</b> class...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
public class Magnet
{
    <b>public int X;</b>
    public string Text;
	
    public Magnet( <b>int x,</b> string text )
    {
        <b>this.X = x;</b>
        this.Text = text;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>...and here's how the tests generally look, using the new constructor...</p>

<pre class="code">
[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...
    [Test]
    public void TwoMagnets()
    {
        <b>magnets.Add( new Magnet(10, "Hello") );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet(20, "World") );</b>
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>You'll notice that we aren't actually using the positions provided in
   the constructor yet, but we've assigned them ascending numbers so that
   the tests still pass - and they all do.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref4"><h2>Ordering the Magnets</h2></a>


<p>It's now time to look again at the failing test that led us to refactor. As
   modified to use our new magnet object, it looks like this...</p>

<pre class="code">[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...

    [Test]
    public void TwoMagnetsInWrongOrder()
    {
        <b>magnets.Add( new Magnet(20, "World") );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet(10, "Hello") );</b>
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }
}</pre>

<p>It still fails, but now we have enough info to make it pass. We'll
   make one final change to our code that allows it to pass more easily.</p>
   
<p>Up to now, we've been building the text string as magnets are added. We could
   continue to do that, but it seems simpler to just save the magnets somewhere
   and sort them appropriately when we're asked for the text. We modify
   <b>MagneticSurface</b> as follows...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
public class MagnetSpace
{
    <b>private List&lt;Magnet&gt; magnets = new List&lt;Magnet&gt;();</b>

    public string Text
    {
        get 
        {
            <b>magnets.Sort();
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

            foreach(Magnet mag in magnets)
            {
                if ( sb.Length > 0 )
                    sb.Append( ' ' );
                sb.Append( mag.Text );
            }

            return sb.ToString();</b>
        }
    }

    public void Add(Magnet magnet)
    {
        <b>magnets.Add(magnet);</b>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Now both of the tests that use two magnets fail with an 
   <b>InvalidOperationException</b>. In order to sort a List, the objects
   contained in it need to implement the <b>IComparable</b> interface. In the
   case of <b>Magnet</b>, that's easy enough...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
public class Magnet <b>: IComparable</b>
{
    public int X;
    public string Text;

    public Magnet(int x, string text)
    {
        this.X = x;
        this.Text = text;
    }

    <b>int IComparable.CompareTo(object other)
    {
        Magnet m = (Magnet)other;
        return this.X.CompareTo(m.X);
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<p>We're taking advantage of some of the constraints we established in the
   <a href="poetry_magnets_part1.html">first part</a> of the series. Since
   magnets may not overlap, we can assume that a magnet with a greater X coordinate 
   comes after one with a lesser coordinate. We're also assuming that the magnets
   all lie in one line, a restriction we'll remove next.</p>
      
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref5"><h2>Adding a Dimension</h2></a>


<p>Here's the next test we want to make pass...</p>

<pre class="code">
[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...
    <b>[Test]
    public void TwoLinesOfMagnets()
    {
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 10, 7, "Hello" ) );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 20, 10, "I" ) );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 25, 10, "Am" ) );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 15, 10, "Here" ) );
        magnets.Add( new Magnet( 20, 7, "World" ) );
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World\nHere I Am", magnets.Text );
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<p>Notice that we've kept the Y coordinates for the magnets on each line the
   same. This is in keeping with our constraint that magnets in a line match up
   perfectly with one another - for now anyway. In order to make this compile, 
   we again change the <b>Magnet</b> constructor...</p>
   
<pre class="code">
public class Magnet : IComparable
{
    public int X;
    <b>public int Y;</b>
    public string Text;

    public Magnet(int x, <b>int y,</b> string text)
    {
        this.X = x;
        <b>this.Y = y;</b>
        this.Text = text;
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>We modify all our other tests to pass in a constant Y coordinate to the
   constructor and are able to compile. The latest test fails, since we are not
   using the Y coordinate in our sort. On my system, the text becomes...</p>
   
   <pre class="code">"Hello Here World I Am"</pre>
   
<p>Let's try simply changing the code of the CompareTo() method...</p>

<pre class="code">
public class Magnet : IComparable
{
    ...
    int IComparable.CompareTo(object other)
    {
        Magnet m = (Magnet)other;
		
		<b>int result = this.Y.CompareTo(m.Y);
		if ( result != 0 )
		    return result;</b>
			
        return this.X.CompareTo(m.X);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This still fails, but we're closer. The text is now...</p>

<pre class="code">"Hello World Here I Am"</pre>

<p>...without the new line character. This is easy to fix in the code that 
   actually creates the text string...</p>

<pre class="code">
public class MagnetSpace
{
    private List&lt;Magnet&gt; magnets = new List&lt;Magnet&gt;();

    public string Text
    {
        get 
        {
            magnets.Sort();
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            <b>int lastY = 0;</b>

            foreach(Magnet mag in magnets)
            {
                if ( sb.Length > 0 )
                <b>{
                    if ( lastY != mag.Y )
                        sb.Append( '\n' );
                    else
                        sb.Append( ' ' );
                }</b>
                sb.Append( mag.Text );
                <b>lastY = mag.Y;</b>
            }

            return sb.ToString();
        }
    }

    public void Add(Magnet magnet)
    {
        magnets.Add(magnet);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Once again, all our tests pass.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref6"><h2>So What Have We Accomplished?</h2></a>


<p>Well, we've solved some of the basic aspects of the problem. We still haven't
   dealt with lines of text that don't quite line up. And we still assume that all
   magnets are perfectly horizontal.</p>
   
<p>In fact, the constraints we have not yet removed are exactly those that
   I set initially in <a href="poetry_magnets_part1.html">part one</a>. 
   In the next two parts this series, we'll finally relax each of them.</p>
   
<p>So far, we have changed our "design" at least four times.</p>

<ol>
   <li>We went from a string to a Magnet object.</li>
   <li>We added an X coordinate to Magnet.</li>
   <li>We went from building the text as magnets were added to keeping a list
       of magnets and building the text when it was requested.</li>
   <li>We added a Y coordinate to Magnet.</li>
</ol>

<p>We certainly could have planned some of this up front, but we suffered very
   little slowdown by starting simply and refactoring as needed. More important,
   we avoided building in "features" that we don't need.</p>
   
<p>Of course, you might say that we have only solved the easy parts up to now.
   So let's see what happens when we deal with "jagged" lines of magnets in the 
   next article of the series.</p>
