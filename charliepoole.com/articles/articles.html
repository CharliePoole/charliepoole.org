				poetry on a refrigerator. The magnets have words on them and

                NUnit Assert provides the building blocks you need to create meaningful
                tests for your application. The new Assert extensibility mechanism
                allows you to add your own assertions that work along side those that
                are built into NUnit.

                In the final article of this series, we finally do what we set out to do.
                The wizard generates code tailored to a specific class in the solution

                In the second article of this series, the wizard actually does what

                In this first article of a series on writing a test fixture generation
                wizard for Visual Studio, I describe the framework of a wizard and how 
                it is called. Even though my first cut at a wizard does nothing but 
                display the parameters passed to it, there were a lot of obstacles
                to overcome in getting there...

                In this experience paper prepared for a workshop at XP2002, I try

                a certain project. We turned the project around, but was that enough?

                In this last article - at least for a while - we adapt the design to a

                After so much code being added, some refactoring was called for,

                In this second article in the series, we develop the ability to parse 
                simple constant expressions. I changed things several times as I was
                developing the parser, so this part is in four different installments.

                 as a way to encourage the practice test-first development. I participated.
                 Bill provided a set of tests that drive the development of a simple
