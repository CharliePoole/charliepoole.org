<a name="ref1"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>


<p>Assertions are pretty important. Everything we do in setting up a unit-test is
   preparation for making an assertion. If it fails, the test fails.</p>
   
<p>The ideal test contains a single assertion. With one assertion, the
   name of the test can be chosen to give all the information that might otherwise
   have to be placed in a custom message. This isn't always possible, so we
   often finish a test method with a series of related assertions that perform
   what we view as one logical test.</p>

<p>Ideally, we would have a way to express that <i>logical assertion</i>
   in a single statement. Putting it another way, we want each assertion to
   do as much work as possible and to return as much information as possible 
   when they fail.</p>
   
<p>If we would like to create our own assertions, NUnit provides the basic building
   blocks in the Assert class. We can compare two objects for equality or identity, 
   test a boolean expression for truth or falsehood or check whether an object is null. 
   Building on these assertions, it's possible to develop more complex tests.</p>
   
<p>But that doesn't mean it's easy! Using these simple building blocks directly means 
   that the developer must provide all the code to make the checks as well as building
   a meaningful error message in case of failure.</p>
   
<p>To better understand the problem, let's look at two cases in which we might
   want an extended assert method. In the first case, we'll write all the code
   to make the test and produce an error message ourselves. In the second, we'll 
   use a new feature of NUnit that allows us to leverage its internal Assert 
   mechanism to make the tests we need.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref2"><h2>Checking the Type of an Object</h2></a>


<p>Suppose we are testing a factory method that returns an object...</p>

<pre class="code">object GetInstance( int typeCode ) { ... }</pre>

<p>Depending on the typeCode argument, objects of different classes will be returned.
   We need to test that the object returned in a certain situation is of a certain
   type or one derived from it. As a first cut at a solution, we might write this</p>

<pre class="code">Assert.IsTrue( theObject is SomeType );</pre>
   
<p>This makes the correct check, but gives no particular error message. In some 
   cases, that might be OK: for example, in this context:</p>
   
<pre class="code">[Test]
public void CheckThatReturnedObjectIsSomeType()
{
    object theObject = factory.GetObject();
    Assert.IsTrue( theObject is SomeType );
}</pre>

<p>See how good practices help? The name of the method tells us exactly what 
   went wrong. Even so, it would be useful to know the type of the object that
   was actually returned. NUnit overloads each of its Assert methods
   to take a user-provided message. Since NUnit 2.2, it has been possible
   to add an optional list of parameters. Taking advantage of this feature,
   we can write</p>
   
<pre class="code">Assert.IsTrue( theObject is SomeType,
               "Expected oject to be type SomeType, but was {0}",
               theObject.GetType() );</pre>
               
<p>which gives us a pretty clear message. The only drawback of this approach
   is that we must write three lines of code each time we need to check the
   type of an object. So we'll extract a method that can be used by all the
   tests in the fixture.</p>
                                    
<pre class="code">void AssertObjectType( Type expectedType, object theObject )
{
    Type actualType = theObject.GetType();
    if ( !actualType.IsAssignableFrom( expectedType ) )
        Assert.Fail( 
               "Expected object to be type {0}, but was {1}",
               expectedType,
               actualType );
}</pre>

<p>Now we can write</p>

<pre class="code">AssertObjectType( typeof( SomeType ), theObject );</pre>

<p>in any test that needs to check the type of an object.</p>

<p>Notice that we had to change our algorithm slightly in order to use a type
   passed as an argument. When we first did this, our test failed because we
   got confused about which type should be assignable from the other. Obviously,
   you wouldn't write an extension like this without tests, would you?</p>
   
<p>After trying this out in a single test fixture, we decided that it was
   useful enough to include in our standard test utilities. We put it in
   a class called <span class="c">TypeAssert</span> in our test utility assembly. The 
   class looks like this</p>
   
<pre class="code">public class TypeAssert
{
    public IsType( Type expectedType, object theObject )
    {
    Type actualType = theObject.GetType();
    if ( !actualType.IsAssignableFrom( expectedType ) )
        Assert.Fail( 
               "Expected object to be type {0}, but was {1}",
               expectedType,
               actualType );
    }
    
    ...
    
    // Other methods that examine types

    private TypeAssert() { }
}</pre>

<p>It's a good idea for a team to have a set of utility classes that
   are commonly needed in their tests. Some of these will be more or
   less generic, like our TypeAssert, while others will relate to the
   application under development. Some teams like to keep those two
   sets in two different libraries.</p>

<p>TypeAssert is usable as it stands. While we could have used some of
   the extensibility techniques you'll read about next, it didn't seem 
   necessary for this problem. Anyway, I wanted to show you some alternative 
   ways of doing things.</p>
   
<p class="comment">You'll find a more fully worked out TypeAssert, with several 
   additional methods, in the NUnit extensions directory, beginning with 
   version 2.2.3.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref3"><h2>Case-Insensitive String Comparison</h2></a>


<p>It's common to want to compare two strings for equality without regard to
   case. Using the existing methods in Assert, the usual approach is to
   write something like</p>
   
<pre class="code">Assert.AreEqual( "expected string", actual.ToLower() );</pre>

<p>This has the benefit of simplicity and leverages NUnit's ability to create
   a useful message, even for very long strings. But it has a drawback. Any error
   message displayed will show the lower-case version of the actual string. If
   we attempt to extract this as a method, we will have to convert the expected
   string as well, increasing the chance of a confusing message.</p>
   
<p>An alternative is to display the strings ourselves:</p>

<pre class="code">Assert.IsTrue( "expected string" == actual.ToLower(),
               "Expected: expected string\n" but was{1}",
               actual );</pre>

<p>This avoids the problem of the first approach, but costs us its advantages.
   For long strings, the entire length will be displayed and we won't see
   a caret marking the point where the strings diverge. With a fair bit of work,
   we could create a method that provides these features. However, they already
   exist in NUnit and we would prefer an approach that takes advantage of that fact.</p>
   
<p>We'll develop such an approach shortly. But first, let's take a look at what
   we mean by "extending" Assert.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref4"><h2>Approaches to Assert Extensibility</h2></a>


<p>Past approaches to extending Assert relied on inheritance from
   the Assert class. Doing so allows us to use protected methods of
   Assert and to access both our extensions and the original public
   assertion methods through the derived class</p>
   
<p>In practice, however, this has presented a number of problems:</p>
   
   <ol>
   <li> The Assert class consists entirely of static methods and 
   is not intended to be instantiated. Originally, its constructor
   was private for that reason. As a stop-gap measure, it was given 
   a protected constructor in an earlier release, so that individuals
   wanting to extend Assert would not have to modify NUnit in order
    to do so.</li>
    <li> Use of inheritance makes the derived class depend on Assert
    in its entirety. This tends to create more coupling than is 
    desirable and extensions created in this way have a tendency
    to be somewhat brittle.</li>
    <li> The meaning of inheritance, as applied to a class that is
    never instantiated, is somewhat vague. No polymorphism is involved,
    but the derived class is simply able to make use of the static
    methods of the base. This makes many of us uncomfortable.</li>
    <li>If methods are added to the base class for the benefit of
    derived classes, they too must be static. Naming problems arise
    when different derived classes need slightly different behavior.</li>
   </ol>

<p>We noticed that many of the problems described are normally dealt
   with in object-oriented programming by use of polymorphism. We needed
   an object. Starting with NUnit 2.2.1, we have one and the creation
   of extended Asserts has become much simpler.</p>

<p>In the new model, each individual assertion is represented by an object.
   It might have been logical to call these objects Assertions, but that name
   is already used in the NUnit framework. For that reason, we call them
   Asserters and the interface they must implement is <span class="c">IAsserter</span>, defined
   as follows:</p>
   
<pre class="code">public interface IAsserter
{
    void Assert();
}</pre>

<p>The built-in Assert methods are now implemented by creating an asserter 
   object and passing it to the <span class="c">Assert.DoAssert</span> static method. The object
   then does all the work: making the appropriate test and - in case of
   failure - formatting a message and throwing an <span class="c">AssertionException</span>.</p>
   
<p>An example may help here. The <span class="c">Assert.IsNotNull()</span> method previously
   checked the argument and threw an appropriate exception if it was null.
   Now it passes all the work to a <span class="c">NotNullAsserter</span>. The code looks 
   like this</p>
   
<pre class="code">public void IsNotNull( object anObject, string message, params object[] args )
{
    DoAssert( new NotNullAsserter( anObject, message, args ) );
}</pre>

<p>Of course, the NotNullAsserter object must now do everything that
   was previously done in the static method. In this simple case, it may not
   be clear what - if anything - has been gained. But by introducing
   an added layer of indirection, we provide a point of extensibility
   within the assertion mechanism. We can now create new asserter objects
   and use that mechanism to test and report on conditions such as those
   described earlier - and on others that we have not yet imagined.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref5"><h2>The TypeAssert Extension</h2></a>


<p>Going back to our original problem set, let's take a look at the need
   for asserting that an object is of a certain type.</p>
   
<p>Since we no longer wish to inherit from Assert, we'll package our
   method - and possibly other type-related asserts - in a TypeAssert
   class.</p>
   
   <pre class="code">TypeAssert.IsType( typeof( SomeType ), theObject );</pre>
   
<p>By the way, we developed this class test-first but in this article we're only
   interested in the final result. Here it is, with an extra method thrown in.</p>
   
   <pre class="code">public class TypeAssert
{
    public void IsType( Type expected, object theObject )
    {
        Assert.DoAssert( new IsTypeAsserter( expected, object ) );
    }
    private TypeAssert() { };
}</pre>

<p>Yup, that's the whole thing! Of course, we now need a IsTypeAsserter class,
   which will implement the IAsserter interface, defined as follows:</p>
   
<pre class="code">public interface IAsserter
{
    void Assert();
}</pre>

<p>Here is a first cut at our IsTypeAsserter class</p>
 
   <pre class="code">public class IsTypeAsserter : IAsserter
{
    private Type expected;
    private object theObject;
    
    public IsTypeAsserter( Type expected, object theObject )
    {
        this.expected = expected;
        this.theObject = theObject;
    }
    
    public void Assert()
    {
        if ( !theObject.GetType().IsAssignableFrom( expected ) )
            throw new AssertionException(
                "Expected Type: {0}\n      but was: {1}",
                expected, theObject.GetType() );
    }
}</pre>

<p>We can do better by leveraging some of the classes provided by NUnit, but
   we'll save that for the next example. You'll find a slightly different implementation
   of TypeAssert in the extensions directory of NUnit 2.2.3 and later.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref6"><h2>The StringAssert Extension</h2></a>


<p>You may have noticed that our implementation of <span class="c">TypeAssert</span> does not allow
   for a user provided message or formatting arguments, which makes it inconsistent
   with the standard Assert methods. For <span class="c">StringAssert</span> we'll do a full-blown
   implementation. Here's the code</p>

<pre class="code">public class StringAssert
{
    static public void AreEqualIgnoringCase( 
           string expected, string actual, string message, params object[] args )
    {
        Assert.DoAssert( new EqualIgnoringCaseAsserter( 
           expected, actual, message, args ) );
    }

    static public void AreEqualIgnoringCase( 
           string expected, string actual )
    {
        AreEqualIgnoringCase( expected, actual, string.Empty );
    }
}

private class EqualIgnoringCaseAsserter : AbstractAsserter
{
    private string expected;
    private string actual;
    
    public EqualIgnoringCaseAsserter( 
        string expected, string actual, string message, params object[] args )
            : base( message, args )
    {
        this.expected = expected;
        this.actual = actual;
    }

    public override void Assert()
    {
        if ( string.Compare( expected, actual, true ) != 0 )
        {
            AssertionFailureMessage msg = new AssertionFailureMessage( message, args );
            msg.DisplayDifferences( expected, actual, true );
            throw new AssertionException( msg.ToString() );
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>Our asserter class inherits from NUnit's <span class="c">AbstractAsserter</span>, which 
   provides fields to hold the user message and parameters and can do some
   basic formatting of the message. In this case, we used another NUnit class,
   <span class="c">AssertionFailureMessage</span> to provide message formatting.</p>
   
<p>By doing a comparison that ignores case, but still displaying the strings
   that were actually used, we are able to create a more meaningful message.
   Use of the <span class="c">AssertionFailureMessage</span> class gives us messages that are
   consistent in appearance with those displayed by the
   built-in Assert methods.</p>
   
<p>NUnit provides a number of asserter classes, which you may want to use
   in deriving your own extensions:  
   <ul>
       <li><b>AbstractAsserter</b> is the base class for all the NUnit built-in assertions</li>
       <li><b>ConditionAsserter</b>, derived from AbstractAsserter, is the base for
           the built-in condition assertions IsTrue, IsFalse, IsNull and IsNotNull.</li>
       <li><b>ComparisonAsserter</b>, derived from AbstractAsserter, is the base class for
           all the built-in assertions taking expected and actual arguments.</li>
       <li><b>EqualityAsserter</b>, derived from ComparisonAsserter is the common base for
           both EqualAsserter and NotEqualAsserter</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>Examine the source code to see how these are used.</p>

<p class="comment">NUnit version 2.2.2 and later includes a more complete implementation
   of StringAssert in the extensions directory. 
   In addition to AreEqualIgnoringCase(), it includes a number of other
   useful methods for working with strings.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref7"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>


<p>Development of a set of customized assertion methods is a key to productive
   test-writing for NUnit. In many cases, a private method in one of your
   test fixtures will be all that is needed. In others, you may wish to 
   deploy one or more assertions so that they can be reused by the entire
   development team.</p>

<p>NUnit's new Assert extensibility model allows tailoring specific assertions
   for your application in a way that is consistent with the basic NUnit 
   assertions. These extensions can provide messages that are consistent
   in appearance with those provided by NUnit and use features of the
   NUnit framework to avoid duplication.</p>
   
<p>For more information, consult the source code for the versions of TypeAssert
   and StringAssert that are provided with the latest versions of NUnit.</p>
