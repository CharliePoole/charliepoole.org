<h1>NUnit Extended: Writing Addins<br>
<span class="author">Charlie Poole</span><br>
<span class="date">10/28/2006</span></h1>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref1"><h2>The MaxTime Attribute</h2></a>


<p>As a first addin, we will create an attribute that specifies the maximum time
   a test case should take to complete the case. We'll write it like this:</p>

<pre class="code">[Test, MaxTime(20)]
public void SomeTest()
{
	...
}</pre>

<p>If the maximum time is exceeded, the test should be marked as a failure with 
   a special message. However, if the test fails for some other reason, or is 
   ignored, the original message should be retained.</p>

<p>The syntax above suggests the use of a TestDecorator - an addin that modifies
   the behavior of a test after it has been constructed. It would also be possible
   to use a TestCaseBuilder here but that would require duplicating a lot of the 
   logic already present in the test case.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref2"><h2>Getting Recognized</h2></a>


<p>As a first step, let's get NUnit to recognize and load our addin. We'll be 
   able to see the addin listed by NUnit, but it won't do anything. This code 
   to do this is quite simple and is identical for all types of addins.</p>

<p>If you are working in Visual Studio, create a new library project. Add a
   reference to the nunit.core.interfaces assembly in your installed copy of 
   the NUnit 2.4 Beta 2. It's best to avoid making extra copies of this assembly, 
   so set Copy Local to false for this reason.</p>

<p>Add a class to the assembly containing this code...</p>

<pre class="code">using NUnit.Core.Extensibility;

[NUnitAddin(Description="Causes a test to fail if takes longer than a specified maximum time")]
public class MaxTimeDecorator : IAddin
{
	public bool Install( IExtensionHost host )
	{
		return false;
	}
}</pre>

<p>If you are working from the command line, create the above with any editor 
   of your choosing. Compile it using the command</p>
   
<pre class="code">csc /target:library /r:nunit.core.extensibility.dll MaxTimeDecorator.cs</pre>

<p>Copy the dll you just created into the bin\addins subdirectory of your NUnit 
   installation, creating the addins directory if necessary.</p> 

<p>Start NUnit and display the list of loaded Addins using the Tools | Addins 
   menu item. Two addins should appear: the RepeatedTestDecorator addin, which 
   comes with NUnit, and the addin you just created. If you select MaxTimeDecorator 
   in the list, the description from the attribute is displayed.</p>

<div class="sidebar">

<p>If you're an experienced practitioner of Test-Driven Development, you may be 
   wondering why we merely observed the loading of the addin instead of first 
   writing a test. There are several good reasons for this.</p>

<p>First, loading the addin is actually NUnit's job. The idea is that we don't
   generally test "other people's code" especially if it's already tested. 
   Second, the only way to write such a test currently is to access some of the 
   internals of NUnit. The problem with that is that it changes the environment 
   of your test significantly, since tests do not normally access the NUnit core. 
   In fact, accessing the core from your test may cause the addin to fail to load!</p>

<p>So, for now, we are sticking with simple observation for testing that the addin 
   works with NUnit's infrastructure. At some future point, there may be some 
   utilities that will allow automating this part of our development.</p>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref3"><h2>Getting Installed</h2></a>
 

<p>You'll note that the IAddin interface only has a single method, and that we 
   didn't really do anything in it. Our addin is known to NUnit, but not yet 
   installed. Before we do that, lets define a few terms.</p>

<p>NUnit provides <b>ExtensionPoints</b>, grouped into three types: Core, 
   Client and Gui. In this Beta, only Core extensions are supported, and that's 
   what we are writing. ExtensionPoints are identified and accessed by a unique 
   name.</p>

<p>An <b>ExtensionHost</b> provides a specific set of <b>ExtensionPoints</b>. 
   In this Beta, there is only one host. It examines the list of Addins for 
   those that contain Core extensions and invites each one to install itself.</p>

<p>An <b>Addin</b>, as used the term is used in NUnit, means some set of functionality 
   implemented by one or more <b>Extensions</b>. In our example there is only one 
   Extension but other addins might need to install several different extensions 
   in order to do their job. Each <b>Extension</b> is installed at an <b>ExtensionPoint</b>.</p>

<p>[[[DIAGRAM?]]]</p>

<p>For details of the <b>IAddin</b>, <b>IExtensionPoint</b> and <b>IExtensionHost</b>
   interfaces, see the NUnit documentation.</p>

<p>We can modify the code above to get our addin installed...</p>

<pre class="code">public bool Install( IExtensionHost host )
{
	IExtensionPoint decorators = host.GetExtensionPoint( "TestDecorators" );
	if ( decorators == null ) return false;

	decorators.Install( this );
	return true;
}</pre>

<p>The above fails to install the decorator. Unfortunately, the Beta release 
   gives no indication of this unless you run it with Trace activated. You 
   can do this from Visual Studio by setting ...</p>
   
<p>To <b>really</b> get installed, we need to implement the interface that
   required by the TestDecorators extension point: ITestDecorator.</p>
   
<pre class="code">public interface ITestDecorator
{
    Test Decorate( Test test, MemberInfo member );
}</pre>

<p>The single method is passed a reference to the Test being constructed and
another reference to the MemberInfo - either a Type or MethodInfo - being
used to construct the test. If the decorator doesn't want to modify the
test, it can simply return the same reference.</p>

<p>In our case, we only want to modify tests that have the MaxTime attribute
   on the MemberInfo.</p>

<pre class="code">    public Test Decorate( Test test, MemberInfo member )
    {
        if ( member is Type ) return test;
		...
    }</pre>
