<h1>XP Haiku</h1>



 
<div class="sidebar">
   <p>In a discussion thread on the <i>Extreme Customering</i> list,
      Kent Beck happened to say that he'd like to be able to write haiku.
   	  A brief flurry of poetry from various folks ensued.</p>
   
   <p>Just for fun, I captured some of them on this page. I'd love
      to receive more, particularly those that actually express the
	  XP values and practices.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">

<p>As you might expect from our group, some of the verse is self-referential. 
   Since we've been giving Kent lots of advice, he decided to thank us in
   true haiku style, starting from an observation of nature:</p>
   
<p class="haiku">
   Hawk meets rabbit<br>So writing advice comes<br>Email winging</p>
   
<p>Hmmm... what's he trying to tell us? Dossy Shiobara certainly isn't pleased.
   He overcomes his normal shyness to comment:</p>
   
<p class="haiku">
   Kent Beck writes about<br>hawks and rabbits and email<br>but he makes no sense.</p>
   
<p>Meanwhile, Joshua Kerievsky is just warming up, as he wonders whether
   to go for a haiku version of his workbook:</p>

<p class="haiku">
   it has been years<br>since I wrote a haiku<br>hello old friend</p>

<p>Dossy is apparently planning to rewrite the white book as haiku. 
   So far, it's going well - he's completed the title page:</p>

<p class="haiku">
   Extreme Programming<br>Embrace Change, told by Kent Beck<br>Write Software Better</p>

<p>I'd like to get more and better ones that talk about the values and practices.
   Here's one I wrote.</p>

<p class="haiku">
   Get ready, fire, aim<br>Re-aim until arrival<br>Courage required</p>
   
<p>Jaap Beetstra had something to say about stories, tests and emergence.</p>

<p class="haiku">
   Customer wishes<br>Programmers make all tests pass<br>Design emerges</p>

<p>Here's one that's dear to my TDDing heart, contributed by Apoorva Muralidhara</p>
<p class="haiku">    
   The test bar glows red<br>I code with simplicity<br>The test passes now</p>
