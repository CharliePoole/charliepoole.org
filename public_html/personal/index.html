  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>I'm putting this site back online after a hiatus. It was not updated for many years
     and has been offline for a while due to server issues. What's here is rather
     out of date, but I'll be working to update it in the coming months.

  <h2>What&apos;s Here</h2>
   
  <p>This is my personal home page, aimed at family and friends. Of course, anyone
     is welcome to browse but if you&apos;re interested in my professional activities,
     then <a href="/home.html">this is the page</a> you want.</p>

  <p>Currently, the site has some info for and about my family. I plan to update it with
     more photos and pages about travels and other interests.</p>
        
  <!--<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>At this point in my life, I have a lot of interests beyond software development. 
   I try to limit my work to 6-8 months each year, although it's not always possible.
   When not working, I'm involved in travel, sailing and family activities and I
   dedicate a lot of time to working with the local schools. I'm very interested
   in exchange programs and have taken groups of high school students on extended 
   trips to Russia twice.</p>
   
  <p>I live in a pleasant area across Puget Sound from Seattle and enjoy being
   involved in community activities. I'm a member of the Spectrum Community School 
   Human Rights board and have a strong interest in alternative schools. I've been 
   recognized on several occasions for my contributions, including receiving the 
   Year 2001 award of the S'Klallam Tribal Anti-Racism Committee. I serve on the
   Capital Facilities Advisory Committee for the school district. One of my great
   pleasures has been to organize an annual Thanksgiving Dinner for students
   at the Spectrum Community School.</p>-->
