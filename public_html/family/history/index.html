  <h1 >The Poole Family</h1>

  <p>I started this section of the site a long while back with the intention of 
     having pictures of my immediate family. It has been pretty much dormant for
     a long time. I'm gradually adding info, focusing right now on the older stuff.
     I'll bring it up to date for the current generation "real soon now."

  <h3>The Pooles of Richmond Hill</h3>

  <p>For me, "the Pooles" will always mean my father's family. Their quirks dominated
     much of my childhood and things about them still come back to haunt me today. 
     My dad, Charles Thomas Poole, was one of 13 brothers and sisters, all shown
     in the picture.
	 
  <p>In this photo they are lined up in order of age. From front to back, we have 
     Tom, Margaret, Theresa, Loretta, Catherine, Monica, Agnes, Mary, Jim, Charlie, 
  	 Jack, Joe and Bill. They appear to be standing in the back yard of the
	   family home at 8782 115th Street in Richmond Hill, Queens, New York.
	   
	<p>These are all the children of William W. and Mary E. Poole, who were married 
     around 1897. 
		
	<p>William was born in Ireland in June, 1865 and immigrated to the United States 
     in 1889, according to info given in the US Censuses for 1900 and 1910. The earliest 
     possible record of William I have found is in the 1892 New York State Census. The 
     entry there shows him as 29, which is two years older than he should be according 
     to later census records. However, he is in Brooklyn and told the census-taker he 
     worked as a carpenter, which is consistent with later entries. The 1892 entry shows 
     him as born in Ireland but he was already a US citizen. Maybe they did things more 
     quickly back then.
	
	<p>Mary was born Mary E. Head in August, 1875, in New York State. So far that's all 
    I know about her early life.
	
	<p>The 1900 US Census shows William and Mary living at 452 Sixteenth Street, Brooklyn.
     They have been married for three years and already have three children: William 
     (born in August, 1897), Mary (August, 1898) and John (November, 1899). These are the 
     folks I was later to know as Uncle Bill, Aunt Minnie and Uncle Jack (Father John Poole).
	
	<p>By the time of the 1905 New York State Census, three more children have come along. 
     Agnes was born in 1902, Charles (my father) in 1903 and Joseph in 1904. William is still 
     working as a carpenter. They have moved to 452 Sixteenth Street in Brooklyn.
	
	<p>The 1910 US Census shows three more kids: James, Monica and Catherine. The 1920 Census 
     finds Mary a widow, with four more children at home: Loretta, Theresa, Margaret and Thomas. 
     She is now 44 and is the head of a household with 13 children, ages 5 to 22. They now live 
     in Richmond Hill, Queens, at 8782 115th Street, the house I knew as the family home,
     maintained by "the girls" - my aunts Minnie, Monica and Loretta. I haven't found William's 
     death certificate yet, but I'm guessing he may have passed away four or five years sooner.
     Otherwise, there would be more children! It's also not clear how or when they acquired the 
     house. It must have been a big step for them, moving from Brooklyn out to Queens, and to a 
     house of their own.
	
	<p>At the time of the 1930 census, they are still in the house. Mary, the mother, is now 54.
    Four of the 13 children have left home: William, John, James and Catherine. Presumably, 
    the latter three had already entered their respective religious orders. The house has a 
    valuation of $10,000 at this point, which must have been an enormous sum. In the 1930 census, 
    the government wanted to see how many families were adopting the latest technology, so there 
    was a column to indicate who had a radio. The Pooles had one!
	
	<p>The picture must have been taken some few years after 1930, since it shows Jack, James and 
    Catherine in their religious dress, while Theresa and Margaret are still "civilians."
	
	<p>The 1940 census finds son William back in the home and indicates he is a widower. So far,
    I have found no record of this first marriage. The form indicates he was living in Brooklyn 
    five years earlier, in 1935. Mary (Minnie), Monica, Loretta and Thomas are still living at home. 
    The others have left home or - in the case of Agnes - passed away. 
	
	<p>In this year, the house is valued at $7000. Tom is working as a stenographer for the "Dept of 
    Com." (Commerce?) and made $1560 the preceding year, making him the top wage-earner of the
    household. Mary and Loretta both worked as stenographers as well, earning $1040 and $360 
    respectively. William earned $1200 as a "Statition" (statisticion?, technician?) in the theater 
    industry.
	
	<p>Respondents to the 1940 census were asked about their level of education. We learn that the 
    mother, Mary, had two years of high school. William, Minnie, Loretta and Thomas completed high 
    school, while Monica surprisingly had only an eighth grade education.
	
	<p>Mary E. Poole, the mother was to live four more years. We know she died on January 5, 1944.

	<p>More to come as I find more records...

  <p><b>Note:</b> The next two sections are just outlines for pages I'd like to develop. The links currently lead to empty pages, which I'll eventually fill in.
	 
  <h3>The Next Generation</h3>
  
  <p>You'd think there would be more of us, given the number of people in the
     picture above! But only four of them had offspring: Tom, Charlie, Joe
	 and Bill.
	 
  <p><a href="thomaspoole.html">Thomas Poole</a> married Eileen Byrnes and they had one daughter, 
      <a href="eileenpoole.html">Eileen Poole</a>.
      Locating my cousin Eileen after all these years was what inspired me
	  to create this site.
	  
  <p><a href="charlestpoole.html">Charles T. Poole</a> married Mary Conklin and they had two children, 
     <a href="charlesfpoole.html">Charles F. Poole</a> (that's me) and <a href="agnespoole.html">Agnes Poole</a>.
	 <!--See <a href="../personal">my personal site</a> for more about this branch of the family.-->
	 
  <p><a href="josephpoole.html">Joseph Poole</a> had at least two children and moved to Philadelphia quite
     a long time ago. We are not in touch with his descendants yet, but we're
	 working on it.

  <p><a href="williampoole.html">William Poole</a> was married, widowed and then married again. He and his second wife Muriel [?] had one child, William Poole, known to us as Billy. We know Billy has passed away and have contact info for his widow Carol so maybe we'll learn more there.
	 
  <h3>Generations Three and Four</h3>
  
  <p>I have three children: John, Marie and Michael. John has a daughter, Beverly, 
     and a son, Kyle. Michael has a daughter, Izabel.
	
  <p>Agnes has two children: Catherine and Marie. Cathy has two daughters, Sidney and Cameron.
  
  <p>Eileen has a daughter, Christine and a grandson Jamie.
  
  <p>Eventually, there will be pages for all these people.
