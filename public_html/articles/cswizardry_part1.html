<a name="ref1"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>


<p>Let's face it. Wizards are handy. Sure, you can type stuff in, but it's nice to
   just click on a few controls and have the code generated for you. And Visual
   Studio has lots of nice wizards to do exactly what you want... well maybe not
   exactly. That's when you start thinking about rolling your own.</p>
   
<p>This article is about the process of writing a C# wizard to generate test
   fixture classes. I'm using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nunit">
   NUnit</a> version 2.0 as a test framework. It identifies
   test fixtures and methods by use of attributes, which seems in the .Net spirit.
   NUnit is an open source project so you can download and use it for free.</p> 

<p>To make things a bit more interesting, I wanted my wizard to generate
   test stubs for each public method of an application class selected by the user.
   The class could be in the same project or another project in the same solution
   and will be chosen through a dropdown list.</p>
   
<p>There is a lot of info in the Visual Studio documentation for writing your own
   "wizards" but most of it is based on using the wizard dll that Microsoft provides.
   By use of templates, JScript and HTML, you can accomplish quite a lot. If you'd 
   like to try this approach, take a look at 
   <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/acsAddTestFixture.htm">
   Ron Jeffries' article</a>.</p>
   
<p>But that's not what I wanted to do. I'm writing Windows forms code in C#, and 
   I'd like to write my wizards the same way. So in this article, I'll first 
   describe how to set up a basic "do nothing" wizard and then gradually add
   to it. The steps I'm showing are pretty much the order in which I figured
   it out myself, but since this is a how-to article, I've left out some of
   the false starts and dead ends.</p>
    
<p>The sidebar gives a preliminary introduction to how Visual Studio finds and
   executes wizards. You may find it useful to read this before continuing.</p>
   
<div class="sidebar">

<a name="ref2"><h2>How Wizards Work</h2></a>


<p>There are three main categories of C# wizards that Visual Studio can invoke.
   <dl>
      <dt>Project Wizards</dt>
          <dd>Used to create new projects, e.g. the Windows Application Wizard</dd> 
          <dt>Item Wizards</dt>
          <dd>Used to add items to a project, e.g. the Add Class Wizard</dd>
          <dt>Context Wizards</dt>
          <dd>Used to add something to an existing item, e.g. the Add Property Wizard</dd>
   </dl>
   As far as I know, it's not possible to have your own Context Wizard called
   without writing a Visual Studio Addin (maybe a future article) but
   the other two are relatively straightforward.</p>
   
<p>Both Project and Item wizards are found by Visual Studio in the same way:
   <ol>
      <li>A file of type .vsdir is found in a known location under your Visual
                  Studio install root - "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET"
                  if you took the default values for installation.</li>
          <li>For a C# Item Wizard, that known location is the set of subdirectories
              under the VC#\CSharpProjectItems subdirectory If there are multiple 
                  files of this type in the same directory, their contents are combined.</li>
          <li>Each entry in a .vsdir file contains the relative path of a .vsz file.</li>
          <li>One of the lines in the .vsz file gives the ProgId for the wizard to 
                  be called. Other lines give parameters that are passed to the wizard.</li>
          <li>The ProgId is a friendly name which can be looked up in the registry in
              several steps to eventually locate the correct dll and instantiate the
                  wizard object.        This is the world of COM, so we're talking about 
                  a COM object here.</li>
          <li>Visual Studio calls the Execute method of the wizard object. What happens
              then depends on how we've programmed the wizard.</li>
   </ol></p>
   
</div>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref3"><h2>Creating the Project</h2></a>


<p>Let's get some boilerplate out of the way first. Create a new C# project using 
   the standard Class Library wizard. Or if you prefer just type it all in... I
   don't care. My project is called WizardExample. I renamed the automatically
   created Class1.cs file as Wizard.cs and called the class it implements Wizard.</p>
   
<p>We'll need a few extra references. Use Add Reference and select envdte from
   the .Net tab. That brings in the object model used in Visual Studio. Since we'll
   be using a MessageBox now and a Form later, we also need a reference to
   System.Windows.Forms. When we create a Windows Application project, Visual
   Studio adds that for us automatically. But since this is a Class Library,
   we need to do it ourselves.</p>

<p>Edit the Wizard.cs file to add some using statements and a new attribute on
   the class. It should end up looking something like mine, depending on what
   you have called everything.</p>
   
<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure">

<pre class="code"><b>
using System;
using EnvDTE;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace WizardExample.Step1
{
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Summary description for Wizard.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        [ProgId("Wizard.Example.Step1")]
        public class Wizard
        {
                public Wizard()
                {
                        //
                        // TODO: Add constructor logic here
                        //
                }
        }
}
</b></pre>

</div>Figure 1 - A Do-Nothing Wizard</div>

<p>System.Runtime.InteropServices is the namespace that contains everything related
   to communication between .Net programs and older types - COM for example. We are
   using its ProgIdAttribute class when we apply the attribute of the same name
   to our class in the line
<pre class="code">
        [ProgId("Wizard.Example.Step1")]
</pre>
   When it sees this attribute, Visual Studio does a lot of work that COM programmers
   once did by hand. It creates a wrapper class that allows our class to be called 
   as a COM object. It also generates code to register our
   dll correctly so that it can be located by its ProgId. The particular ProgId 
   you select is up to you. I put Step1 in the name so I could have several
   versions of my wizard available at one time.</p> 

<p>Before compiling this, we need to change a project setting so that the COM
   Interop registration is performed. Go to the project's property pages and under
   Configuration Properties look at the Build sub item. Change the setting
   "Register for COM interop" to <b>True</b>. Make sure you select All Configurations
   in the drop-down list when doing this. Otherwise, only the current configuration
   - probably Debug - of your dll will be registered when you build it. If you later
   switch to a release build, you'll find the wizard no longer runs.</p>

</div>Figure 2 - Settings for COM Registration</div>

<p>When you compile, you should
   see the following message in the Output window.
   <pre class="code">Registering project output for COM Interop...</pre> 
   Now we just have to make it do something!</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref4"><h2>Making It a Wizard</h2></a>


<p>What makes a wizard a wizard? Basically, it's a dll with a class that
   implements the IDTWizard interface. That interface contains only one
   method, defined as follows:
<pre class="code">
void Execute(
   object Application,
   int hwndOwner,
   object[] ContextParams,
   object[] CustomParams,
   ref wizardResult retval );
</pre>
   This is the method that Visual Studio calls to activate our wizard. See the
   sidebar for the meaning of the arguments.</p> 

<div class="sidebar">

  <a name="ref5"><h2>Execute Method Arguments</h2></a>

  
  <dl>
          <dt>Application</dt>
          <dd>The root object of the Visual Studio environment.</dd>
          <dt>hwndOwner</dt>
          <dd>Handle of the parent window for any windows we display.</dd>
          <dt>ContextParams</dt>
          <dd>Standard parameters that differ according to how the wizard is called.</dd>
          <dt>CustomParams</dt>
          <dd>Array of parameters set in the .vsz file that called us.</dd>
          <dt>wizardResult</dt>
          <dd>Return value passed back to Visual Studio.</dd>
  </dl>
  
</div>

<p>Just to have something for our effort, and to show how wizards get called,
   I fixed up the code for my initial wizard to display some information.
   Figure 3 shows what I ended up with.</p>

<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure">

<pre class="code">
[ProgId("Wizard.Example.Step1")]
public class Wizard : IDTWizard
{
    <b>private string wizardType;

    private string projectName, itemName;
    private string localDirectory, installDirectory;

    private ProjectItems projectItems;</b>

    public Wizard()
    {
    }

    <b>public void Execute ( object application , 
                             int hwndOwner , 
                             ref object[] contextParams , 
                             ref object[] customParams , 
                             ref EnvDTE.wizardResult retval )
    {
        wizardType = (string) contextParams[0];
        string msg;
                        
        if ( wizardType.ToUpper() != 
                EnvDTE.Constants.vsWizardAddItem )
        {
            msg = "WizardExample was called incorrectly."
                + "This wizard is designed to add items "
                + "to a project.\n\nThe .vsz and .vsdir "
                + "files should be installed in the";
                + "VC#\\CSharpProjectItems directory.";
                                
            MessageBox.Show( msg, "WizardExample" );

            retval = wizardResult.wizardResultFailure;
            return;
        }

        projectName = (string) contextParams[1];
        projectItems = (ProjectItems)contextParams[2];
        localDirectory = (string) contextParams[3];
        itemName = (string) contextParams[4];
        installDirectory = (string) contextParams[5];

        msg = "WizardExample was called with "
            + "the following arguments:\n\n"
            + "Wizard Type:\tAdd Item\n"
            + "Project Name:\t" + projectName + "\n"
            + "Project Items: (collection passed as 
            + "third argument)\n"
            + "Local Directory:\t" + localDirectory + "\n"
            + "Item Name:\t" + itemName + "\n"
            + "Install Directory:\t" + installDirectory + "\n\n"
            + "Custom Parameters:";

        foreach( string s in customParams)
            msg += "\n\t" + s;

        MessageBox.Show( msg, "WizardExample" );

        retval = wizardResult.wizardResultSuccess;
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<p>The Execute method saves the information passed to it in various private fields
   of the object - we'll need them in later stages. It checks the first field
   before doing anything else to avoid exceptions which would be thrown otherwise.
   We're working in the late-bound world here, and we can't be sure we know the
   types of the objects we were passed without checking the context of the call.</p>
   
<p>If we were called as anything but an Add Item wizard, we can't do anything
   but give an error message and exit. If you'd like to see this message, I'll
   tell you how to make it show up later. If we were called properly, we get
   the rest of our arguments and display all the strings in a message box. The
   Project Items collection is something we'll use later.</p>

</div>
   
<div class="section">

<a name="ref6"><h2>Calling the Wizard</h2></a>


<p>Visual Studio invokes wizards through a file of type .vsz. Mine is called
   WizardExampleStep1.vsz and I saved it in my VC#/CSharpProjectItems directory. 
   It really doesn't matter where I save it, but this will turn out to be a 
   convenient place. It's a text file, and contains the following lines:
<pre class="code">
VSWIZARD 7.0
Wizard="Wizard.Example.Step1"
Param="Some parameter string"
Param="Another parameter string"
</pre>
   The first two lines are all that is required. The value given in quotes
   after Wizard= matches the ProgId of our wizard, which is how the system
   is able to find and execute it. The two param lines are just there
   to give the message box something to display.</p>

<p>We're not quite done, however. Visual Studio needs to be told to list
   this wizard as an option when adding a new item to a project. The Add Item
   dialog has a tree structure on the left and icons representing available
   items on the right. The tree structure is determined by the contents of the 
   VC#\CSharpProjectItems directory in your Visual Studio .Net installation.</p>
   
<p>For this example, we'll make our wizard appear under Local Project Items. I 
   created a file called WizardExamples.vsdir in that directory. The name I used
   is unimportant and I could even have edited the existing .vsdir file, but using
   a separate file makes it easier to avoid messing up other things. Initially,
   this file will contain a single line, a set of tokens separated by pipe symbols.
   Later, we can add other lines as we complete more wizards. See the sidebar for
   a description of the tokens. Unused tokens should be replaced by 0.</p>
   
<div class="sidebar">
  <a name="ref7"><h2>Tokens in the .VSDIR File</h2></a>

  <dl>
          <dt>RelPathName</dt>
          <dd>Required. The relative path to the .vsz file.</dd>
          <dt>{clsidPackage}</dt>
          <dd>Optional. A GUID representing a product with localized resources.</dd>
          <dt>LocalizedName</dt>
          <dd>Optional. The text to display under the icon in the Add Item dialog</dd>
          <dt>SortPriority</dt>
          <dd>The relative ordering of this item compared to others.</dd>
          <dt>Description</dt>
          <dd>The text to display when the icon is selected in the dialog.</dd>
          <dt>DLLPath or {clsidPackage}</dt>
          <dd>Path or GUID for an application that contains the icon to display.</dd>
          <dt>IconResourceId</dt>
          <dd>The icon resource id. [I copied this and the preceding item from Add Class.]</dd>
          <dt>Flags</dt>
          <dd>Flags that indicate what dialog fields are available. With 0 you get vanilla.</dd>
          <dt>SuggestedBaseName</dt>
          <dd>The template to use for the item file name. Visual Studio adds 1, 2... as needed.</dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>Here is the whole line from my file. It's broken into two pieces for readability
   but if you copy and paste it, put it all in one line.</p>

<pre class="code">
..\WizardExampleStep1.vsz|0|Step 1|45|Just displays a message|
{FAE04EC1-301F-11d3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}|4515|0|WizardExample.cs
</pre>

<p>With these two files in place, we are ready to test. Run another
   copy of Visual Studio to be sure you pick up the new wizard. Later on, we may need
   to debug this, so it's convenient to set the project's Debug Mode
   to Program, and the application to the Visual Studio environment itself (devenv.exe)
   and run it that way. Open a project under your new instance of Visual Studio. 
   Right now we aren't changing anything, but later we will, so a throwaway project 
   is useful. I keep a TestProject around with a single class and a single form.</p>

<p>Select Add New Item from the Project menu or by right-clicking on the project
   in Solution Explorer. If you placed the files where I did, you should see
   an icon marked Step 1 under Local Project Items. If you highlight it, you'll 
   see the text "Just displays a message". Select it and the dialog box should 
   appear looking something like Figure 4.</p>

<div class="floatright"><div class="figure">
   <div class="floatnone"><img src="cswizardry_image2.gif"></div>
</div>Figure 4 - Wizard Output</div>

<p>If you aren't seeing the icon displayed under Local Project Items, either the
   .vsdir file is incorrect or you don't have a .vsz file at the relative location
   pointed to by the first token. If you see a message saying that your wizard
   can't be executed, you probably forgot to change the project properties to
   do the COM registration. If the program executes but some unexpected error
   is thrown, you can debug it by stepping through just as with any other library.
   Set devenv.exe as the application to run and set your breakpoint before firing
   off the wizard.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see the wizard display its error message, copy the .vsdir file
   into the CSharpProjects directory and the .vsz file into the VC# directory - that
   way the relative path will still be correct. Run a copy of Visual Studio and
   try to add a project. One of the choices is now Step 1. But when you select
   it, the wizard displays the message telling you that your files are in
   the wrong place.</p>

<p>You can put a copy of the .vsdir file into the Web Project Items directory 
   if you want to see it when you're working on a web project. You can also make
   it appear in one of the subcategories, "Code" for example, by copying it into
   that directory and modifying the relative path to the .vsz file accordingly.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref8"><h2>What's Next?</h2></a>


<p>We still haven't generated any code using the wizard.
   In the next article in this series, we'll do that and even provide the
   user with a way to make some choices about how the code is generated.
   In the third and final article, we'll actually tailor the tests that are 
   generated to a target class selected by the user.</p>
