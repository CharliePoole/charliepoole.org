<h1>Poetry Magnets: First Verse<br>
<span class="author">Charlie Poole</span><br>
<span class="date">November, 2005</span></h1>





<p>In a recent thread on the TestFirstDevelopment list, Bill Wake asked for some help 
   defining an algorithm for reading cards, which are laid out on a table. Even though the cards
   are not perfectly lined up, the human eye and mind can perceive alignments. After
   a bit of discussion, Bill offered a metaphor to help us understand the problem...</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
   Think of this as a simulation of magnetic poetry on a refrigerator. (If you haven't 
   seen it, there are a bunch of magnets with words on them, and people arrange them 
   into messages.) The user drags these rectangles into an arrangement. 
   Since we aren't too precise, the arrangement looks a little like a ransom note 
   - you know, where someone has glued phrases from a newspaper. They aren't in a 
   perfect line, but the human reader has no trouble.
</blockquote>

<p>That got me thinking. Even if it's only a metaphor for the real problem, it's a pretty
   interesting one, and sounds like fun. Let's see I can solve it using a test-driven 
   approach, rather than discussing various algorithms in advance...</p>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref1"><h2>A Quick Design Session</h2></a>


<p>Right at the start, we should make sure we understand the problem we've decided to solve.
   Here's a rewording of the problem, with some additonal specifications
   the "Customer" - that's me - has provided...</p>

<ul>
   <li>Magnets with words on them are placed on a surface. The 
       magnets are rectangular in shape and are all the same height. Their length 
       varies depending on their content. They may be placed in any location and
	   oriented horizontally, vertically or at some other angle. Due to physical
	   limitations, they may not overlap.</li>
   <li>The program should take a list of magnets, with the location, orientation 
       and content of each one, and produce a text string that concatenates them 
       in the order a human would read them. The text should be broken into lines
       if the layout "looks like" a set of lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>My approach will be to do the simplest thing first. In particular, I plan to
   define some additional constraints at the start and remove them as I go along. 
   So initially, I'll limit my tests as follows...</p>

<ul>
   <li>Magnets are always perfectly horizontal. This allows great simplification
       initially. I wonder if it might be a problem later... well, we'll find
	   out as we go along.</li>
   <li>Magnets on the same line are always perfectly aligned. As a result, 
       magnets with different Y coordinates will always be in different lines.
       I expect this to give us erroneous results eventually, but we'll deal with that
	   when it happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can forsee needing two objects. A <b>MagneticSurface</b> on which the magnets
   are placed and the <b>Magnets</b> themselves. I don't think it would necessarily
   be a <b>BadThing</b> to create both of them right away, but - just for fun - let's 
   start out with only the surface.</p>

<p>That's the end of our design session. It really was quick, wasn't it?</p>

<a name="ref2"><h2>First Test</h2></a>


<p>When I was younger and less experienced, I thought that speed of programming
   was simply a matter of style. Some people are faster, others slower. Some take
   very small steps, others larger. These days, I've come to understand that speed
   of programming and size of steps are a matter of technique. Depending on the
   problem at hand, my confidence in understanding both it and the technology
   and too many other factors to list, I may need to <b>choose</b> a different
   speed at which to work and a different step size for my tests.</p>
   
 <p>In this case, I'm going to program in fairly small steps at first. I could 
   easily go faster, and when I do the problem again I may. But it's good to warm 
   up before exercise and I'd like this article to be understandable to readers 
   who are new to TDD as well as to the veterans. For those who find the pace
   too slow, meet me in the next installment, where we'll speed things up a bit.</p>

<p>It's often useful to start with the do-nothing test case and that's what I've done here...</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    [Test]
    public void NoMagnets()
    {
        MagneticSurface magnets = new MagneticSurface();
        Assert.AreEqual( "", magnets.Text );
    }
}</b>
</pre>

<p>To make this compile, I need to create the <b>MagneticSurface</b> class...</p>

<pre class="code">
<b>public class MagneticSurface
{
    public string Text
    {
        return null;
    }
}
</b>
</pre>

<p>I had to have a <b>Text</b> property to satisfy the compiler. I deliberately
   made it return a value - <b>null</b> - such that the test would fail. Here's
   the error message...</p>

<pre class="code">
expected: &lt;""&gt;
 but was: &lt;null&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is easy enough to fix...</p>

<pre class="code">
public class MagneticSurface
{
    public string Text
    {
        <b>return "";</b>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The first test passes now. I could have made it pass right away, but it's
   reassuring to see the failure - the red bar - followed by passing - the
   green bar.</p>

</div>
    
<div class="section">

<a name="ref3"><h2>Getting the Word Out</h2></a>


<p>Having handled the case with no magnets on the surface, the next logical
   step is to put one there. So let's do that...</p>

<pre class="code">
[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    [Test]
    public void NoMagnets()
    {
        MagneticSurface magnets = new MagneticSurface();
        Assert.AreEqual( "", magnets.Text );
    }

    <b>[Test]
    public void OneMagnet()
    {
        MagneticSurface magnets = new MagneticSurface();
        magnets.Add( "Hello" );
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello", magnets.Text );
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<p>To make this compile, we have to modify our production class...</p>

<pre class="code">
public class MagneticSurface
{
    public string Text
    {
        return "";
    }

    <b>public void Add( string magnet )
    {
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<p>Of course, the test fails, since we still are returning the empty string. Failure
   is just what we are looking for here. Now we can fix the code and see the bar turn green...</p>


<pre class="code">
public class MagneticSurface
{
    <b>private string text = "";</b>

    public string Text
    {
        <b>return text;</b>
    }

    public void Add( string magnet )
    {
        <b>this.text = magnet;</b>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The tests are passing, but we see some duplication: both tests
   create a new <b>MagneticSurface</b> object. We can use a <b>SetUp</b>
   method to remove the duplication, while still getting a fresh
   object to work with in each test. Let's do that before moving on...</p>

<pre class="code">
[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    <b>private MagneticSurface magnets;

    [SetUp]
    public void BeforeEachTest()
    {
        magnets = new MagneticSurface();
    }</b>
 
    [Test]
    public void NoMagnets()
    {
        <span class="strike">MagneticSurface magnets = new MagneticSurface();</span>
        Assert.AreEqual( "", magnets.Text );
    }

    [Test]
    public void OneMagnet()
    {
        <span class="strike">MagneticSurface magnets = new MagneticSurface();</span>
        magnets.Add( "Hello" );
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello", magnets.Text );
    }
}
</pre>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref4"><h2>Two in a Row</h2></a>


<p>The next step that will drive us forward seems to be adding multiple words.
   So as not to tempt fate, let's try two...</p>

<pre class="code">
[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...

    <b>[Test]
    public void TwoMagnets()
    {
        magnets.Add( "Hello" );
        magnets.Add( "World" );
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }</b>
}
</pre>

<p>Of course, we're only saving the last magnet added, so the new test fails
   with the message...</p>

<pre class="code">expected: &lt;"Hello World"&gt;
 but was: &lt;"World"&gt;</pre>

<p>At this point, we have a choice. We can either build up the text as magnets
   are added or we can save all the magnets, creating the text only when we
   are asked for it. Either way will work for this test and we can always 
   refactor later. I'm going to use the first approach for now, since
   it's the simplest thing to do...</p>

<pre class="code">
public class MagneticSurface
{
    <b>private string text = "";</b>

    public string Text
    {
        <b>return text;</b>
    }

    public void Add( string magnet )
    {
        <b>if ( this.text != string.Empty )
            this.text += " ";
        this.text += magnet;</b>
    }
}
</pre>

<p>All the tests are passing now. We could do tests with three, four or more
   magnets, but it doesn't look as if that would teach us anything more about
   the code. It would be OK to write those tests, but we'd be doing testing, 
   not Test-Driven Development.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref5"><h2>You're Out of Order!</h2></a>


<p>While we've made some tests pass, we clearly have not yet addressed one
   of the major issues of the problem we are trying to solve: figuring out
   the best order in which to put words together. So far, we've merely
   concatenated the test on the magnets in the order they were added to
   the surface. That's far from useless: these basic tests must continue
   to pass no matter how we modify our approach. To demonstrate the 
   problem, we add another test...</p>

<pre class="code">[TestFixture]
public class MagnetTests
{
    ...

    <b>[Test]
    public void TwoMagnetsInWrongOrder()
    {
        magnets.Add( "World" );
        magnets.Add( "Hello" );
        Assert.AreEqual( "Hello World", magnets.Text );
    }</b>
}</pre>

<p>This one fails, as expected. What's more, we can't make it pass in
   any useful way without breaking the earler <b>TwoMagnets</b> test.
   Oh sure, we could do them in alphabetic order, but that doesn't 
   seem like a fruitful path to follow.</p>

<p>The problem is that we aren't providing enough information. Magnets
   are supposed to have a location as well as text content. Using a
   string to represent the magnet won't take us much further. In
   addition, our decision to build up the text as magnets are added
   appears to limit our options at this point.</p>

<p>It's good to take a break on a red bar. That way, when you return
   to the program, you know exactly what needs to be fixed next. So
   lets end this episode right here. But first, let's have a...</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref6"><h2>Retrospective</h2></a>


<p>I like to end each verse... uhh, I mean iteration... with a 
   retrospective. What did we do? What went well? What problems
   arose? What would we do differently next time?</p>

<p>In this case, we started very simply. We postponed creating
   an object to represent the magnets and used a string instead.
   We took this approach as far as we could and we'll clearly
   need to refactor before we can move ahead with our tests.</p>

<p>Is this a problem? Should we have thought ahead? Time will tell,
   but I don't think so. None of this took long to do and even if
   we erased it all and started over, what we learned in the process
   would stay with us and make the rewrite easier.</p>

<p>That said, I don't think we'll need to do anything quite so drastic. Next
   time, we'll take the code as it is and try to take the
   location of the magnets into account.</p>
