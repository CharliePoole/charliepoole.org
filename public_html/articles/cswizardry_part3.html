<a name="ref1"><h2>Aren't We There Yet?</h2></a>

<p>In the <a href="cswizardry_part1.html">first</a>
   and <a href="cswizardry_part2.html">second</a>
   articles of this series, we developed a wizard in C# that could actually
   generate code and add it to our project! We took Windows Form-based input
   from the user to tell how it was to be generated. But our original goal was
   to do a bit more. We wanted to be able to generate a test fixture for a 
   particular class in the project, with a test method for each public method
   of the class.</p>

<div class="floatright"><div class="figure">
   <div class="floatnone"><img src="cswizardry_image5.gif" height=336 width=396></div>
</div>Figure 1 - New Wizard Form</div>

<p>Let's consider what we need to be able to do that. We'd like to get a list of
   all the classes in a project and display them on a form, so that the user
   can select one. In fact, since a Visual Studio solution may have more than one 
   project, we'll need to get a list of projects as well. This will take
   us beyond a single input form, so we'll need a mechanism to sequence through
   the different forms both forward and - since it's expected of Wizards - backward.
   Finally, when we generate the code, we'll have to look at all the methods in
   a class and select the public methods for generating tests. We know that
   other things may come up along the way, but this list of tasks is enough
   to get us started.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref2"><h2>A New Form</h2></a>


<p>Let's start with the form. I decided to give the user the choice of 
   generating a fixture for a specific class, one with a few sample tests
   or an empty fixture. Figure 1 shows the form I designed for this purpose.</p>

<p>The second form is the same Options form that we saw in the previous article, 
   except now it's labeled as "Step 2 of 2."</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref3"><h2>Wizard Changes</h2></a>


<p>Having two forms means the wizard class has to keep track of which one
   should be displayed at any given moment. Figure 2 shows the changes in
   this class from our earlier version.</p>
   
<p>The first thing you'll notice is that I changed the name of the class for
   my final version to be CSharpAddTestFixtureWizard. It's also now saving
   the value of the "application" parameter passed to Execute()
   in a private variable of type DTE. DTE stands for Development Tools Extensiblility
   and it's the top-most interface to the entire Visual Studio extension mechanism.
   The wizard uses this to retrieve the Solution object, which is a new read-only
   property it supports.</p>
   
<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure"><pre class="code">
[ProgId("<b>CSharpAddTestFixtureWiz</b>")]
public class <b>CSharpAddTestFixtureWiz</b> : IDTWizard
{
    <b>private DTE appDTE;</b>

    private string wizardType;

    ...

    <b>public Solution Solution
    {
    get { return appDTE.Solution; }
    }</b>

    public void Execute ( object application , int hwndOwner , 
           ref object[] contextParams , ref object[] customParams , 
           ref EnvDTE.wizardResult retval )
    {
        <b>appDTE = (DTE) application;</b>
        wizardType = (string) contextParams[0];
			
        ...
		
        <b>int step = 0;
        Form[] form = { new TestFixtureTypeForm( this ), 
                        new TestFixtureOptionsForm( this ) };

        while ( step >=0 &amp;&amp; step < form.Length )
        {
            form[step].ShowDialog();

            switch( result )
            {
                case wizardResult.wizardResultSuccess:
                    ++step;
                    break;
                case wizardResult.wizardResultBackOut:
                    --step;
                    break;
                case wizardResult.wizardResultCancel:
                case wizardResult.wizardResultFailure:
                default:
                    retval = result;
                    return;
            }
        }

        if ( step > 0 )
            result = generator.Generate();</b>

        retval = result;
    }
}
</pre></div>Figure 2 - Updated Wizard Code</div>

<p>The wizard now has code to determine which of a number of forms is to be displayed
   and to step forward and backward through those forms. To keep things as clean
   as possible, both forms are created right at the start. If the logic got
   more complicated than it currently is,
   we might need a separate object to handle this. But for two forms, this code
   seems to be the right level of specialization.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref4"><h2>Projects And Classes</h2></a>


<p>Our TestFixtureTypeForm - that's the name of our new form class - fills a 
   combo box with a list of the projects in the current solution when it
   loads for the first time. Figure 3 shows the methods that do the job.</p>

<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure">
<pre class="code"><b>private void AddProjectsToCombo()
{
    int targetProjectIndex = -1;
    foreach ( Project project in wizard.Solution.Projects )
    {
        if ( HasTestableClasses( project ) )
        {
            int index = projectComboBox.Items.Add( project );
            if ( project.Name == wizard.ProjectName )
                targetProjectIndex = index;
        }
    }

    if ( targetProjectIndex >= 0 )
        projectComboBox.SelectedIndex = targetProjectIndex;
    else if ( projectComboBox.Items.Count > 0 )
        projectComboBox.SelectedIndex = 0;
}

private bool HasTestableClasses( Project project )
{
    try
    {
        return project.FileName != "" &amp;&amp;
            HasTestableClasses( project.CodeModel.CodeElements );
    }
    catch
    {
        // Ignore projects that throw an exception due
        // to language subsystem not being installed,
        // or being an unmodeled project type.
    }

    return false;
}
</b></pre>
</div>Figure 3 - Adding Projects to the ComboBox</div>

<p>We loop through all the project objects in the current solution, checking each
   of them to see if it has any classes for us to test. This eliminates things
   like install projects, for example. The project object itself is added
   to the combo box, which displays the name of the project by virtue of 
   having its DisplayMember property set to Name. If the project into which 
   we are adding the test fixture is placed on the list, we select it in the
   combo box. Note however, that it won't be in the list if it's a new empty project.</p>

<p>The HasTestableClasses method introduces a new concept.
   A Visual Studio Project object may have a CodeModel, which is a representation 
   of all the code elements in the project. Using the code model, it's possible to 
   find an element by it's qualified name, determine the language of the
   project and identify various subelements - as we are about to do. By the
   way, in this demonstration program, we are making the assumption that
   all the projects in a solution are written in C#. This is a pretty big
   assumption, since Visual Studio supports multiple-language solutions and
   a robust implementation of this wizard might need to deal with the 
   possibility of other languages. For an explanation of some of the code
   elements we will be using, see the sidebar.</p>
   
<div class="sidebar">
  <a name="ref5"><h2>CodeModel Objects</h2></a>

  <dl>
	<dt>CodeModel</dt>
	<dd>The object that represents all the code subelements in a project. Among
	other things, it can tell you the language of the project, find elements
	by name and add or remove elements.</dd>
	<dt>CodeElements</dt>
	<dd>The collection of individual elements in a CodeModel.</dd>
	<dt>CodeElement</dt>
	<dd>A generalized representation of an individual element in the code model.
	It could be a class, a method, a namespace, etc. For many purposes, it's
	more useful to cast the element as the appropriate derived class than to
	work with it in its general form.</dd>
	<dt>CodeNamespace</dt>
	<dd>A CodeElement representing a namespace</dd>
	<dt>CodeClass</dt>
	<dd>A CodeElement representing a class</dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>As we saw above, HasTestableClasses(Project) delegates its work to
   an overloaded method which takes a collection of CodeElements. In fact,
   the method has two additional overloads, both of which are shown in
   Figure 4.</p> 

<p>The overload that takes a collection of code elements simply looks
   at each element to determine if it is a testable class or has one
   contained in it. Note that the only element which can contain a
   testable class is a namespace and that we check a namespace by looking
   at its members. The type of CodeNamespace's Members property is
   CodeElements, so this leads to another level of recursion.</p>

<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure">
<pre class="code"><b>private bool HasTestableClasses( CodeElements codeElements )
{
    foreach( CodeElement elem in codeElements )
    {
        if ( IsTestableClass( elem ) || HasTestableClasses( elem ) )
            return true;
    }

    return false;
}

private bool HasTestableClasses( CodeElement elem )
{
    if ( !IsNamespace( elem ) )
        return false;

    CodeNamespace codeNamespace = (CodeNamespace) elem;
    return HasTestableClasses( codeNamespace.Members );
}

private bool IsTestableClass( CodeElement elem )
{
    if ( !IsClass( elem) || !IsLocallyDefined( elem ) )
        return false;

    CodeClass codeClass = (CodeClass) elem;
    if ( codeClass.Access != vsCMAccess.vsCMAccessPublic )
        return false;

    foreach( CodeAttribute attribute in codeClass.Attributes )
        if ( attribute.Name == "TestFixture" )
            return false;

    return true;
}

private bool IsLocallyDefined( CodeElement elem )
{
    return elem.InfoLocation 
        == vsCMInfoLocation.vsCMInfoLocationProject;
}

private bool IsClass( CodeElement elem )
{
    return elem.Kind == vsCMElement.vsCMElementClass;
}

private bool IsNamespace( CodeElement elem )
{
    return elem.Kind == vsCMElement.vsCMElementNamespace;
}</b></pre>
</div>Figure 4 - Checking for Testable Classes</div>

<p>To determine whether an element is a testable class, we check
   that it's a class and that it's locally defined. This is to
   avoid looking at any of the framework classes or other classes
   which are not defined in this project. We then convert the
   generic CodeElement object to a CodeClass so we can see if
   it has public access. Finally, we look at the attributes
   on the class for "TestFixture" to ensure that we don't try to
   test our test fixture classes.</p>
   
<p>Several small helper methods are used to encapsulate the checks
   we must make on CodeElements. It's very common in programming
   Visual Studio Wizards and Addins to have to make these checks
   before attempting to cast an object to its proper type.</p>

<p>We make extensive use of the same methods in adding testable classes to
   the second combo box each time a project is selected. The AddClassesToCombo
   method has two overloads which are shown in Figure 5. The first, taking a 
   Project for its argument,
   simply calls on the second, passing in the CodeElements collection from
   that project's CodeModel.</p>

<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure">
<pre class="code"><b>private void AddClassesToCombo( Project project )
{
    classComboBox.Items.Clear();
    classComboBox.Text = "";

    if ( project != null )
        AddClassesToCombo( project.CodeModel.CodeElements );

    if ( classComboBox.Items.Count > 0 )
    classComboBox.SelectedIndex = 0;
}

private void AddClassesToCombo( CodeElements codeElements )
{
    foreach( CodeElement elem in codeElements )
    {
        if ( IsTestableClass( elem ) )
        {
            CodeClass codeClass = (CodeClass) elem;
            classComboBox.Items.Add( codeClass );
            AddClassesToCombo( codeClass.Members );
        }
        else if( IsNamespace( elem ) )
        {
            CodeNamespace codeNamespace = (CodeNamespace)elem;
            AddClassesToCombo( codeNamespace.Members );
        }
    }
}</b></pre>
</div>Figure 5 - Adding Classes to the Second ComboBox</div>

<p>The overload that takes a CodeElements collection as its argument, examines
   each element and adds it to the combo if it's a testable class. It
   also looks at any nested classes to see if they should be added. If
   the element being examined is a namespace, then the method is called
   recursively on its members. As with the project combo, we insert the
   class object itself, relying on the DisplayMember property to show
   the name of the class for us.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref6"><h2>Code Generation</h2></a>


<p>Our code generator gets a few new fields and properties in this version. We
   use an enumeration to indicate which of the three types of code generation should
   be performed, and store the current value in a private member. A property
   exposes it to the outside world. Here's the enumeration:</p>

<pre class="code"><b>public enum TestFixtureType
{
	ClassSpecificFixture,
	SampleFixture,
	EmptyFixture
}</b></pre>

<p>Our original GenerateCSharpFile method generated hard-coded sample tests.
   In our new version, we use a switch statement to select one of three methods
   to be called depending on the type of test fixture being generated.
   InsertSampleTests() inserts the two sample methods we used in the previous 
   version while InsertTestPlaceHolder() puts in a comment to indicate where the
   user should add tests.</p>
   
<div class="floatnone"><div class="figure">
<pre class="code"><b>GenerateCSharpFile()

    ...
	
    switch ( type )
    {
        case TestFixtureType.ClassSpecificFixture:
            InsertClassSpecificTests();
            break;
        case TestFixtureType.SampleFixture:
            InsertSampleTests();
            break;
        case TestFixtureType.EmptyFixture:
        default:

    }
	
    ....
}

void InsertSampleTests()
{
    InsertTestMethod( "SomeMethod" );
    InsertTestMethod( "AnotherMethod" );
}

void InsertTestPlaceholder()
{
    if ( nMethods > 0 )
        WriteLine();

    WriteLine( "//" );
    WriteLine( "// ToDo: Insert your tests here" );
    WriteLine( "//" );
}

void InsertClassSpecificTests()
{
    Hashtable names = new Hashtable();

    foreach( CodeElement elem in targetClass.Members )
    {

            if ( function.Access == vsCMAccess.vsCMAccessPublic
                 &amp;&amp; !names.ContainsKey( function.Name ) )
            {

                {

        }
    }
}

private bool IsFunction( CodeElement elem )
{
    return elem.Kind == vsCMElement.vsCMElementFunction;
}</b></pre>
</div>Figure 6 - Generating Code</div>

<p>To generate tests for a selected class, we retrieve the CodeClass object
   from the combo box and examine all of it's members. The object
   model uses some very general terminology in it's code model, so
   the members we are interested in are of type CodeFunction. For
   each such public member, we look at the kind of "function" it represents.
   Most members are of the vsCMFunctionFunction type, and for them we
   generate a test. We also generate a test for the constructor using the
   name "Construction." A hashtable
   is used to ensure that we only generate one test for a given name, avoiding
   the need to worry about overloads.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref7"><h2>Making It Run</h2></a>


<p>To make this version run, I created
   a file called CSharpAddTestFixtureWiz.vsz and put it in my VC#\CSharpProjectItems
   directory. It contains these two lines.

   <pre class="code">
   VSWIZARD 7.0
   Wizard="CSharpAddTestFixtureWiz"
   </pre>
   In my Local Project Items directory I added a CSharpTestFixtureWiz.vsdir file,
   containing the following line (as usual, broken for readability).
   <pre class="code">
   ..\CSharpAddTestFixtureWiz.vsz|0|Test Fixture|45|
   A class for use as an NUnit TestFixture|
   {FAE04EC1-301F-11d3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}|4515|0|TestFixture.cs
   </pre>
   This gives me a "Test Fixture" item under Local Project Items when I use
   the Add New Item dialog. As explained earlier you can make it appear in
   various locations by creating additional .vsdir files.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

<a name="ref8"><h2>What's It Good For</h2></a>


<p>I started this project with the notion that I wanted to do some sort
   of wizard that involved non-trivial interaction with the Visual Studio
   object model. That goal has been met quite well. I've learned a lot
   about extending Visual Studio and the techniques described will apply
   to other projects - like automatic refactoring of code.</p> 

<p>But I also wanted to create a useful tool for generating test fixtures. 
   So the question arises... 
   <p class="comment">Is this a useful tool to have?</p>
   </p>

<p>I have to answer that question with a qualified "Yes." <i>If</i> 
   you need to generate test cases for a number of classes that don't now 
   have tests, then this tool can help. It still lacks a number of features
   I'd like to see, like the ability to deal with multiple language solutions. 
   But such features can always be added when they are needed, so I think this 
   makes a good start toward a tool that could be used in real projects.</p>

<p>The real question is "Under what circumstances is it useful to have 
   such a tool?" To that, I must say "Only rarely." In most cases, you'll
   be better served by writing one test at a time, before the 
   corresponding application code is written. If you do that, you'll get 
   along quite happily without this tool.</p>

<p>However, for legacy projects, you might consider something like this as
   a quick way of getting a large number of tests. In that case, I'd think
   about modifying the test generation so that the initial tests are flagged
   as non-runnable. This will give you a yellow bar and you'll have to
   actually add some code to see any tests pass at all. Of course, if you
   only want the illusion of tests, you can use it as is...</p>
   
<p>If you'd like to experiment with the wizard described here, the final source 
   code can be downloaded <a href="/downloads/CSharpAddTestFixtureWiz.zip">here</a>.</p>
