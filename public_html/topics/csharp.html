<p>I've written a C# Wizard to create test fixture classes in a Visual Studio
   project. This series of articles describes how I did it.</p>

                In the final article of this series, we finally do what we set out to do.
                The wizard generates code tailored to a specific class in the solution
                selected by the user. But was it worth it?

                In the second article of this series, the wizard actually does what 
                wizards are supposed to do... generate code. There's also a user
                input form that sets some options for the code...

                In this first article of a series on writing a test fixture generation
                wizard for Visual Studio, I describe the framework of a wizard and how 
                it is called. Even though my first cut at a wizard does nothing but 
                display the parameters passed to it, there were a lot of obstacles
                to overcome in getting there...

<a name="ref2"><h2>About C#</h2></a>


<p>C# has a lot going for it but I resisted it at first.</p>

<p>I think that has a lot to do with how it was initially presented in
   certain articles. One author complained that C++ uses . in some situations, 
   :: in others and -> in yet others. The "advantage" of C# was that it
   only used the . operator, so you didn't have to remember the others.</p>

<p>Well, most C++ programmers of any experience will recognize those operators
   as meaning quite different things, and won't have any trouble distinguishing
   them. The fact that a language uses the same operator for all of them
   (not entirely true, in fact) didn't seem like an advantage at all.</p>

<p>So, for a long time, I was put off by the perception that C# was a language
   for folks who just weren't smart enough to do C++. But it turns out that C# 
   has a lot of merit on it's own and in fact it's been my main language for
   the last few months.</p>
